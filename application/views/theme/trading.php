              <p style="font-size:16px;">Listed below are the major types of trading strategies prevalent in the market.</p>
              <p style="margin-top:15px;"><b>1. Day trading</b></p>
              <p>It is a type of trading where traders buy &amp; sell stocks within a single day, from 9:15 am to 3:30 pm. In day trading, the trader purchases the stock, holds it for a few minutes or hours and concludes the transaction before the market closes.</p>

              <div class="">
                <p style="margin-top:15px;"><b>2. Swing trading</b></p>
              </div>
              <div class="">
                <p>In swing trading, a trader usually purchases a stock and holds it for several days or a week to capitalise on the short-term stock patterns &amp; trends. These traders must have adequate knowledge of stock trends and patterns to execute their trades successfully.</p>

              </div>

              <div class="">
                <p style="margin-top:15px;"><b>3. Scalping or micro trading</b></p>
              </div>
              <div class="">
                <p>Scalp trading</a> is a type of trading in which traders buy and sell stocks in large quantities repeatedly several times within a day. This may result in profits even with minute changes in the stock price. However, there is also a high probability of losses.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="">
                <p style="margin-top:15px;"><b>4. Momentum trading</b></p>
              </div>
              <div class="">
                <p>Momentum trading</a> is a strategy where a certain stock price moves either upwards and downwards for a certain period, i.e., it gains momentum. When the peak is reached, a downtrend follows; therefore, traders take a selling position at the peak of a stockâ€™s momentum.</p>
